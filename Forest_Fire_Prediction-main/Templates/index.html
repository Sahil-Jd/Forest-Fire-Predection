Australia’s forest fires are the worst in the country’s recorded history. Already, millions of acres have burned, creating dangerous levels of air pollution, displacing nearly 90,000 people and killing a billion animals.</p>

The purpose of developing this app is to predict fire (the measurement FRP(Fire radioactive power) which can be used to detect fire). This model is based on the Forest Fire Prediction in Australia dataset. We are using the NASA MODIS satellite data for predictions.
       The Australian Forest Fire has been devastating. Thanks to NASA the satellite data by MODIS, data is made available publically.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Forest Fire in Australia are a never-ending story of loss, tragedy, and record-setting moments. Forest Fires in Australia are a widespread and regular occurrence that have contributed significantly to shaping the nature of the continent over millions of years. Fires can cause significant property damage and loss of both human and animal life. The most destructive fires are usually preceded by extreme high temperatures, low relative humidity and strong winds, which combine to create ideal conditions for the rapid spread of fire. It is estimated that the 2019–2020 Forest Fires led to the deaths of at least 33 people and over 3 billion animals. In recent times most major Forest fires have been started in remote areas by dry lightning. Some reports indicate that a changing climate could also be contributing to the ferocity of the 2019–20 fires with hotter, drier conditions making the country's fire season longer and much more dangerous. During periods of drought, the fuel for Forest Fires is greater than normal, and Forest Fires combine to become megafires, generating their own weather and spreading fire further. Strong winds also promote the rapid spread of fires by lifting burning embers into the air. This is known as spotting and can start a new fire up to 40 kilometres downwind from the fire front. Australia's climate has warmed by more than one degree Celsius over the past century, causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and droughts. Eight of Australia's ten warmest years on record have occurred since 2005. A study in 2018 conducted at Melbourne University found that the major droughts of the late 20th century and early 21st century in southern Australia are "likely without precedent over the past 400 years". Across the country, the average summer temperatures have increased leading to record-breaking hot weather with the early summer of 2019 the hottest on record. 2019 was also Australia's driest ever year since 1900 with rainfall 40% lower than average. Heatwaves and droughts dry out the undergrowth and create conditions that increase the risk of Forest Fires. This has become worse in the last 30 years. Since the mid-1990s, southeast Australia has experienced a 15% decline in late autumn and early winter rainfall and a 25% decline in average rainfall in April and May. Rainfall for January to August 2019 was the lowest on record in the Southern Downs (Queensland) and Northern Tablelands (New South Wales) with some areas 77% below the long term average.<br>
       <br>Until the 2019–2020 Australian Forest Fire season, the forests in Australia were thought to reabsorb all the carbon released in Forest Fires across the country. This would mean the forests achieved net-zero emissions. However, scientists now say that global warming is making Forest Fires burn more intensely and frequently and believe the 2019–2020 fires have already released approximately 350 million tonnes of carbon dioxide – as much as two-thirds of Australia's average annual carbon dioxide emissions between October and December 2019.<br>
       <br>Forest Fires produce particulate-matter pollution – airborne particles that are small enough to enter and damage human lung tissue. Following the Hazelwood fire in 2014, Fay Johnston, an associate professor of public health at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research, says young children exposed to smoke either as infants, toddlers or in the womb develop changes to their lung function. She says: "Unborn babies exposed to the Hazelwood smoke were more likely to experience coughs or colds two to four years after the fires." Other studies conducted in Australia show an increase in respiratory diseases among adults stemming from air pollution caused by bushfires. As a result of intense smoke and air pollution stemming from the fires, in January 2020 Canberra measured the worst air quality index of any major city in the world. The orange-tinged smoke entered homes and offices buildings across the capital making breathing outside very difficult, forcing businesses and institutions to shut their doors. Studies show that residents of highly polluted cities also have an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes.

This dashboard has been created using a software called PowerBI which is a product of Microsoft.
        Here we have just attached the images of the dashboard because PowerBI needs oraganizational
        account.<br><br>Fires in the summer are extremely common in some regions in Australia this happens every year. You can say that it is the natural weather pattern there it is called the "Fire season". We can see that the Western Australia and the South-east part of Austrailia are still unsafe and more prone to forest fires whereas central region of South Australia looks to be a safe place. The 2019-2020 season proved to be unprecedented in many ways. 2019 has been declared as the hottest and the driest year in the history of Australia till date. Also we can see that the most of the fires has been occured during the day time. Throughout the summer, hundreds of fires burnt, the major fires peaked during December–January. The proportion of presumed vegetation fires is much higher. </p>
